# Tempest
Tempest was a small game I created for a class over the course of about 5 days using JavaScript and the Three.js library in 2017.

It's a very simple game where the goal is to hit as many rings as possible by moving the camera with "wasd" before the end of the map. You speed up temporarily everytime you hit a ring to make hitting the next one more difficult
